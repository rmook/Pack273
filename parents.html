			<h1>Training</h1>
			<p>All volunteers, Den and Asst. Den Leaders in the pack must complete training. This allows the Pack to recharter each year, makes your experience smoother, and, most importantly, give you the tools to make sure each Cub Scout has a great experience. The Scouting organization has already created the trainings; all you have to do is follow them in a manner that is right for you and your Cub Scouts. Below is a list of mandatory trainings which can be completed on-line or in the recommended Instructor-Lead Job-Specific Training.</p>
			<p>&diams;  Youth Protection Training - (On-line) Approx. 30 min., cannot stop/restart course.</p>  
			<p>&diams;  Fast Start Orientation Training - (On-line) Approx. 35-45 min., stop/start capable. Select the position you're volunteering for, i.e. “Den Leader Fast Start.”</p>
			<p>&diams;  Leader Position-Specific Training - (On-line and LHC Offered Course) This is much faster to do on-line. However, if you are new to the Den Leader or Asst. Den Leader position and time permits and you can attend a scheduled ourse.  Also, the Pack will reimburse the course fee associated with attending the LHC Offered Course.</p>
			<h2>Directions</h2>
			<p>First: To get to the on-line E-Learning, site go to <a href="http://myscouting.scouting.org">myscouting.scouting.org</a> SELECT: Boy Scouts of America - MyScouting.org. At the bottom SELECT: “Create an account." Follow the prompts. </p>
			<p>Second: After creating an account you may need to sign in. Follow the above instructions to get back to “Sign in to MyScouting”. If you're already there, sign in. Look for the grey column on the left with the 
			bold face “My Profile” then below it is “Training” in bold face. Under 
			“Training” SELECT: “E-Learning.”</p>
			<p>Third: As you scroll down you will see tabs, SELECT: “Cub Scout”. From here you can SELECT: “Take Course”, for each course listed on the front page to start your training.</p>
			<p>Here is our council’s site you may find helpful. Training can also be 
			accessed from <a href="http://lhcbsa.org">lhcbsa.org</a> under "training". This web site also provides updates, training, activities, and rescources. You can also register there for Council courses and activities.</p>
